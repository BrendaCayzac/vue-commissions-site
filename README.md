# Vue Commissions Site

##Purpose
To showcase my commissions and online portfolio, I decided to display my 
work on a website. The first iteration of it was made in Google Sites. After 
learning some HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I decided to use my new-found 
knowledge to create a site and display my capabilities for future employers. 
Now, almost a year later, I believe I should re invigorate this idea using 
my latest experiences using Vue.js technology.
